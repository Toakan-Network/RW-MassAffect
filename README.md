# RW-MassAffects
Mass should impact carry speed. So lets make it.

So hear me out, after a bit of discussion  in Mod-Development, I realised that Pawns' aren't actually affected by the mass of the things they are carrying;  apparel, weapons, other pawns, etc. They only really get impacted by the Terrain or Weather.

Well.. I've overwritten the base movement implementation and added that capability.

With this mod, your pawns will now move as slow or as fast as their carry capacity lets them. This should allow some crazy stuff like lightweight gear to increase Pawn movement speed, or wearing a ball and chain to actually slow them down (with the correct Mass setting).
